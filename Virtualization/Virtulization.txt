Virtualization enables the hardware resources of a single computer to be divided into multiple virtual computers, called virtual machines.


Benefits of virtualization:
    a) Resource efficiency
    b) Easier management
    c) Minimal downtime
    d) Faster provisioning
    
Hypervisor is a software component that manages multiple virtual machines in a computer. It ensures that each virtual machine gets the allocated resources and does not interfere with the operation of other virtual machines. There are two types of hypervisors.

There are 2 types of Hypervisiors:
    a) Type1 - with bare metal
    b) type2 - Hosted

    Type1: Type 1 or bare-metal hypervisors interact with the underlying physical resources, replacing the traditional operating system altogether. They most commonly appear in virtual server scenarios.

    Type2: Type 2 hypervisors run as an application on an existing OS. Most commonly used on endpoint devices to run alternative operating systems, they carry a performance overhead because they must use the host OS to access and coordinate the underlying hardware resources.


    Virtualization Vs Containerization
    In virtualization application runs as guest OS on hypervisors, whereas containerization run on host OS, with pre installed code, libraries, OS as well.
