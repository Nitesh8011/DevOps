1. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (check data is receive to dest or not, slow compare to UDP)
2. UDP - (stateless connection) User Datagram Protocol (doesn't check the data after sending used in video call, gaming etc)
3. HTTP
4. HTTPS
5. SMTP
5. POP3 and IMAC
6. SSH
7. VNC
8. Telnet (Port 23)

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Network access translator (NAT)
Internet Protocol (IP) - Port used to receive data on particular application.

1mbps - 1000000 bits/sec
1gbps - 1000000000 bits/sec


Internet is collection of -
    1. Local Area Network (LAN) - connects devices like printers, computers, and servers within a limited geographic area (restricted to a few kilometers), such as a home, school, or office building. Ex- wifi, ethernet

    2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) - Computer network that connects devices within a larger geographic area than a LAN, covering a city or a town. It usually consists of multiple LANs connected together to share resources and data.

    3. Wide Area Network (WAN) - Across countries. Ex- Optical fiber cable

Open systems Interconnection Model (OSI) -
    Own Network:
        a) Application Layer - Application of software that we use
        b) Presentation Layer - Convert data into machine language form in binary
        c) Session Layer - authentication and authorization occurs here
        d) Transport Layer - transfer data in chunks as packages with sequence number and add checksum to every package to check was it good or not.
    Other Network:
        e) Network Layer - best path to take to transfer data from source to dest
        f) Data Link Layer - allows to directly connect
        g) Physical Layer

    ALL     - APPLICATION LAYER
    PEOPLE  - PRESENTATION LAYER
    SHOULD  - SESSION LAYER
    TRY     - TRANSPORT LAYER
    NEW     - NETWORK LAYER
    DOMINOS - DATALINK
    PIZZA   - PHYSICAL LAYER

Port: Ephemeral ports

HTTP Method:
    a) GET
